# Introduction
This project was part of the Distributed and Mobile Systems course, completed with a classmate. At The Chinese University of Hong Kong, many dormitory assignments are based on students' shared interests. This project aimed to simulate the process of collecting student interest survey data and develop a roommate matching system using Python. The system leverages recommendation algorithms and a greedy algorithm to optimize roommate pairings based on interest alignment.

# My Responsibilities:
Sections: 3, 4, and 5
## Main Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a recommendation algorithm using cosine similarity to measure interest alignment.
- Applied a greedy algorithm to optimize roommate pairing.
- Focused on neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based) and implemented similarity calculation methods.
- Leveraged big data analytics to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the recommendation process.
